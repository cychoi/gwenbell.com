About me, the gb. Aka Geebers. Geebs. Gweebs. [...]
----------------

**2013** I'm a [technical writer](http://git.gwenbell.com) and [programmer](http://bitters.gwenbell.com) in Brooklyn, New York. View my [commits](https://github.com/gwenbell).

**2012** I lived and wrote from Berlin, SF, Mexico, Singapore and Japan. As I traveled, I searched for what's next in tech. I didn't find it. So. I moved into my grandparent's basement for three months, ate Nunu's home cookin' and taught myself to program. Before all that I epically lost and then epically won a game of TI3.

**1999** I got my first laptop the same year I started practicing yoga, 99. That makes me 1,247 years old. In **2004** I taught myself HTML and CSS while my red-eared sliders Ari and Yuutsu jumped off their rock. I learned so I could make the website for my yoga studio in Japan. 

####Magazine covers -aka- Shizz that matters to the grandparents

If I have been carted off to the loony bin, my grandparents will be the only ones who can confirm. Call and ask them. I don't have their phone number.

####Dev Note

I run this site on a 5/mo. digital ocean VPS. Sometimes, between my own idiocy, something in Node or the 5 dollar VPS, this site goes down. **DO NOT PANIC!** It's not because I've been picked up and carted off to the loony bin. (Necessarily.) Just holler to let me know. If you're outside the US, holler loud.
