About me, the gb
----------------

I'm a [technical writer](http://git.gwenbell.com) and [programmer](http://bitters.gwenbell.com) in Brooklyn, New York. Read my [open source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/gwenbell) or view my [commits](https://github.com/gwenbell).

Before New York, in 2012 I lived and wrote from Berlin, SF, Mexico, Singapore and Japan. I spent 3 months in each location. As I traveled, I searched for what's next in tech. I didn't find what I was after, so I taught myself to program.

####How I learned to program

I got my first laptop the same year I started practicing yoga, 1999. In 2004 I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could make a website for my yoga studio in Japan. In 2012 I locked myself in a basement until I learned UNIX, Git and Node.js fundamentals. 

Before all that I epically lost and then epically won a game of TI3. You won't understand unless you've played. And lost.

I run this site on a 5/mo. digital ocean VPS.
