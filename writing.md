<a name="roundhouse">The Roundhouse</a>

I first time I published about The Gwendolyn Roundhouse in 2006, on Zaadz. Zaadz means seed in dutch and it was a site that got bought and ruined by a large company. When it was tiny, it was an amazing, thriving place for freaks and geeks.

I wrote about the Roundhouse in 2006, and published it to Zaadz. Here's what I wrote:

<p><mark>(posted to Zaadz May 17, 2006)</mark></p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>This is Gwen.&nbsp; I'm new here and wanted to say hello and introduce myself briefly.</p>
<p>I'm originally from the States but have lived in Japan the past three years and am now in the business of building        <em> sangha </em> through yoga, weekly meditation sessions at the studio &amp; offering health/ healing resource info to the community!&nbsp; Whew.&nbsp; The studio website is:&nbsp; Yoga Garden </a> and I build that site, too. The studio is a vision-in-progress and a goal realized for me.&nbsp; I opened it when I was 23 and in the year since it opened have grown so much with it.&nbsp; Even the studio's motto, &ldquo;grow with it,&rdquo; reflects my life-philosophy.&nbsp; So, you can do it.&nbsp; Every one of you!&nbsp; And that's why I'm at Zaadz, to uplift &amp; encourage!&nbsp; To plant &amp; water seeds!</p>
<p>I have a long-term and longer-term project that I'd like to share with you all.&nbsp; 

The long-term project is to build the        <strong> Gwendolyn Round House </strong> .&nbsp; This is my first time to publicly share this, so it's going to take a moment to explain.&nbsp; The concept is simple.&nbsp; I'd like the house to be round, with no corners&mdash;the base is round, like a circle, and the walls are curved and go straight up (the roof is covered with solar paneling and windows to let in natural light&mdash;how I'm going to curve them is still being thought-out).&nbsp; Not like the Epcot center or even a <a title="GDH" href="http://www.naturalspacesdomes.com/" target="_blank"> geodesic dome home </a> , although the GDH will give you an idea of what I'd like to create.&nbsp; 

I'd like the house to be built with the principles laid out in <em> Voluntary Simplicity </em> , by Duane Elgin.&nbsp; Basically, the inside will not have doors to divide rooms, but moveable partitions, <em> a la </em> Japanese sliding shoji.&nbsp; The energy in the house will move freely, no stuck feeling.&nbsp;</p>

<mark>The Roundhouse, 2013 update (where things get exciting)</mark>

When I lived in Norwich in the Year of Our Lord 2000, I made a sketch of my dream home. I hadn't lived in Japan. I had never taken an architecture course (still haven't) and I sketched what I called The Gwendolyn Roundhouse.

My Italian housemate, an architect (for realzies - he went to school in Italy for a full fucking 8 years) comes home and I go, "Roberto. Let me show you my dream home. You wanna see it?"

And he goes, "Yes! Of course!"

And I pull out this piece of paper with a drawing on it I created a full 13 years ago while living in a tiny dorm room in England. I hadn't been to Japan. I was barely off my mother's breast, you know. Like that twee.

Still, I knew what I wanted my home to look like someday. So I sketched it in that tiny shitty horrible dorm room at UEA. And then, Roberto goes, "Ok. Gwen. Here's what I want for you to do for me. You get a pen, ok. And you trace these lines so I can see them."

So then I traced that whole thing, the Gwendolyn Roundhouse. Line by line, and I found out how I used to write my gs and as, how I used to bear down with my pen. And then I said to Roberto, is this crazy? Like is this too custom? The roof would have to have rounded glass, that's tinted...the technology wasn't there yet in 2000, but I bet it's there now.

And he goes, "Sure sure. This is great. You don't have an architect's mind so you...how do you say it...you don't know what's not possible."

Over the next three days he 3D rendered it for me. My dream home.

13 years after I drew it. (That's why it looks so beat up. I just threw away this sketch today, because Roberto upgraded me!)

So then I emailed back one of my readers who does ancient book refurbs whose work I've never understood.

I said: now I get what you do.

Dreams don't die. People do.

One of my dreams is to bring all my dreams into the world. In so doing I help as many people as I can bring theirs into the world. How do I do that? As a listener, writer, speaker, teacher and apprentice.

####Polylog

Last night I sat in front of a fire at a rooftop dance party at [The Schoolhouse](http://brooklyn-spaces.com/2011/09/the-schoolhouse/) in Bushwick, New York. I was drinking a Weihenstephan, the world's oldest beer. I let the bass from the dj's speakers vibrate me. 

As I listened and drank and watched the fire, I interviewed someone, the artist who has the claw-footed bath tub in his bedroom. When he walks into a room, clothes start dropping. 

I wanted to know his secret, so I asked for an interview. As we talked, his arm draped around my shoulder, the smell of his sweat mixing with mine, it was just. So. 

I derive pleasure from other people's pleasure. In the poly world, there's a word for it. It's called **compersion**.

Though I'm not currently in, nor actively seeking a poly relationship, I have been 1/3 of a poly relationship. I was intrigued as I read about compersion, because I feel it so often and in all my reading and travels, I'd never heard of it. 

I think compersion is **the** secret the mainstream monogamous community doesn't want you to know about. As though the mono culture will break when you derive pleasure from someone else's pleasure. 

Instead, it focuses on drama and jealousy. Two indicators there's a paucity of people and pleasure, and you gotta fight for what's yours. I say there's _more than enough_. There is no _yours_.

So, let's focus on compersion, the other side of the coin.

<hr />

Compersion. There was this time in Sayulita, Mexico when I watched this woman add cream to her coffee. Her hair was long and bleached blonde, and her dining partner had his arm around her shoulders and a little girl played at her feet. She had about twenty-three bracelets on her left wrist. She was wearing sunglasses. There is no way I could ever pull off that look, nor would I necessarily want to. 

Instead, I enjoyed her enjoying herself.

As I watched her take that first sip of her coffee, there at the restaurant. I felt it. I mean, of course, I can't feel what she feels, but I felt **compersion** Just seeing her delight, her love directed at that child, her excitement with her partner, and the delicious coffee to boot.

<hr />

I wish we talked about compersion more. Rappers rap a lot about jealousy, and recently I've talked about it, too. But I don't do jealousy. I almost never experience jealousy. I do compersion. I feel _that_ daily.

The polylog is a dedication to all the things that turn me on. My turn ons are legion.

There's a section or two on compersion in [The Ethical Slut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ethical_Slut). If you want some new sources of pleasure, or at least tittilating conversation, buy a copy and read that book in public.

<hr />

After the conversation with the artist on how he turns the room on, I had a conversation with a fellow developer. I asked him questions, too. He had a harder time getting at what brings him pleasure. He wasn't even sure which programming languages he enjoyes programming in. 

So, I'm bringing two worlds I respect together here. The analytical world on the terminal needs access to this world of pleasure. You could start a pleasure log if you want. Or just take a little pleasure from the pleasure I take. Practice compersion.

####June 2013 Polylog: Things that turn me on (not all examples of compersion) updated 14 June 2013

+ [Bad](http://rapgenius.com/Wale-bad-lyrics). I love this song right now. Wale (pronounced wah-lay) gets it. Tiara Thomas gets it. Fucking sexy.

+ Dreads. Long dreads that smell like earth. Maybe Wale started or continues a trend.

+ Rooftop dance parties in Brooklyn. Yahahahah.

+ When someone says they read something I wrote and it lit them up

+ Drinking just-off-the-boil espresso from a tiny sake cup

+ Tiny gardens, hidden in nooks in huge cities. Like leaves growing in cracks in the pavement.

+ Talking with dead people. I was grateful to write Terminal last month. Grateful the faeries were willing to act as medium

+ Nina Simone's voice

+ Hot, slow, long baths

+ When someone [live-merges my pull request](http://youtu.be/AmHuTYPt0fE?t=53m33s)

+ Learning, then teaching something hard

I'll keep adding to the polylog as it occurs to me to do so. For now, I gotta go do lesson four of Learn Python the Hard Way. Because that's what Gittip is built on, Python. And I get pleasure from contributing to the open source world.

**Wayback machine (unpublished until June 2013): Jan 2011**

I have an amazing amount of clarity right now. Thing about clarity is the moment I start talking about it, like flow, it's gone. But I still want to write while I'm in this place, without saying "oh, that wasn't that clear oh that wasn't really that indicative of clarity."

Just as I am, on the spot. Here's what I've got.

I keep trying to trace it back. Was it when Ev showed up. Was it the Digital Sabbatical. Was it when I stopped wearing my ring and thinking about myself as trapped in a marriage. Was it a place? Was it a phrase? Was it a book? Was it the Sakyong? Was it a decade of practice finally clicking into place? 

Whatever it was, here it is. Here I am.

Each day an empty cup. Each decision from a place of clarity.

If it feels muddled I walk away, I reapproach.

Was it shredding my journals? Was it the blank slate? Was it stopping thinking about myself in a particular fixed-notion way?

The blank slate allowed me to see the labels I'd applied to myself. Now I'm asking which ones still work. Which work is the work. Which way the way.

And what I'm seeing is there is only one way: presence.

Cultivating [presence](http://gwenbell.com/presence) not for some reward. Not for material or spiritual gain. But just cultivating presence. Speaking from a place closer to the source, closer to the truth. Always, closer to truth.

That place of truth presents itself endlessly. I have failed to notice before, but I fail to notice less now.

Committing only in alignment, never in duress, never out of a sense of obligation.

Not one sentence longer than obligated.

####The Genius in You; or, Total Buy-in

**What if you could let the part of your brain stamped EARN rest for a while? Or forever?**

I watched Synecdoche, New York. Then I walked from Brooklyn to Manhattan as the sun set. I walked a total of 16,557 steps, which according to my nano watch was 7.83 miles. I saw four condoms in various states of used. I saw two people sleeping on the street. I witnessed a woman with platinum hair run from one end to the other and back in the time it took me to get to the end of the Williamsburg bridge.

[Ev](http://evbogue.com) suggested Synecdoche because he knows my love for intense programming. 

My two favorite shows of all time are Six Feet Under and The Wire. 

I watched all six seasons as I learned to program in 2012. I thank the last episode of the final season for getting me to New York.

My other favorite show is The Wire, which I almost gave up on during the first episode because I was bored stiff. I stayed with it only because Madeleine Forbes and Ev were all, "give it a chance, man," and now I love it.

<hr />

The other reason Ev suggested Synecdoche is since the start of the week I've given a lot of thought to genius grants. These things actually exist. They're called MacArthur Fellowships. It's all anonymous, which is also true for [Gittip](http://gittip.com). I view Gittip as distributed, peer-to-peer genius grants. Lots of people supporting each other financially so they can work on and do what they love. Those who have more to give, contribute more. Those who are doing the work and need more support, get more.

In Synecdoche, the main character, Caden Cotard (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is given one such genius grant. Though in his case it's not distributed. It's a lump-sum from higher up, rather than little bits from lots of people. His is vertical to Gittip's horizontal. He goes from getting by to having so much income he can do whatever he wants with his time and never thinks about earning again. 

He lets the part of his brain stamped EARN take a permanent vacation.

Sounds great! But when you think about it, especially if you've watched The Wire, you know what I mean when I say The Hustle gives you Purpose. The drive to get some product out the door gives you laser-like focus, and without the boundaries of 'you're running out of cashmoney', you've got to get that pushback from _somewhere_.

<hr />

Caden Cotard is tragic - not semi-tragic, not kinda pathetic melancholy in an Eternal Sunshine kinda way. No, I find him flat-out tragic. This play he's making, funded by the genius grant, goes on for most of eternity, and I don't want to spoil the plot, but there's really no saving graces to this guy. I keep wanting for there to be. But with unlimited funding, it's like he has a permanent case of The Resistance.

If you read my work during 2011 and 2012, you know I got obsessed with The Resistance. After I read _The War of Art_ I started seeing The Resistance everywhere, in everybody, including myself. I couldn't _not_ see it. I was grateful Steven Pressfield had written, finally, the truth about getting things into the world. 

Pressfield covered, in a slim volume, basically every kind of cop out, every excuse I had for not doing the work. Once I got to the end I was all, 'huh. I've done every single one of these things. Now that I know about the Resistance, I'll aim to never have it again!' 

That has almost, but not quite, worked out. 

Anyway, Caden has The Resistance (which, by the way, is contagious), but there's something more pernicious at play. He spends the duration of the film trying to get buy-in. From anybody. His wife, his second wife, his daughter, the people in the play he's staging. He wants them to say: you're an alright kinda guy Caden. You're doing your best. And even when they _do_ say that, he never takes it to heart. He keeps berating himself, wishing he could get _total buy-in_ from _the whole world_. Failing that, he keeps plugging on this play, trying to get _it_ perfect. (Trying to get it perfect is a symptom of the Resistance. You have to hit publish, even if you think it's shit, which you always will. Think it's shit, that is.)

**The only person who can give you total buy-in on your life is you.**

There's no pleasure to this guy's life. He's so caught up in his own _dukkha_ (dissatisfaction in Buddhist), he can't see straight. Sure, he fucks but it's always sad. You know, like he's hoping he could perform a little better. He's weepy and self-absorbed. (Contrast that with self-contained.) 

He never merges with his lover. He holds her at arm's length, wanting, you guessed it. 

Total buy-in.

The only person who will give you total buy-in is you. That's why when someone says to me, 'Oh, I could never write like you do. My life's not that interesting,' I take them at their word. 

I see they haven't bought into their own story.

This isn't to say you don't have to drop the story-_line_. My work isn't just in telling masturbatory stories I like to write that you'll like to read. It's also unplugging for two years to listen to my own voice. To discover whether what I'm telling you is true is true for me, or is it just what you (they, the group/collective) want to hear.

Returning after two years away, I'm clearer now on my voice than I was when I left. And. It turns out, the voice isn't that much different. It's oh! Here I am. And I'm not a whole lot different than when I blank-slated.

Which. Is why I blank the slate. What remains after you blank the slate is as close to true as you're going to get. And you're never going to get to total blank. 

You will never come out clean.

That is what I love about Six Feet Under. None of those characters come out clean, and still, I forgive each of them. I forgive them their foibles and 'shortcomings'. 

I forgive the parts of them I thought I couldn't forgive in myself.

They remind me I can let myself off the hook. Caden _never_ lets himself off the hook. He _never_ builds his pleasure palette. He never takes stock of what brings him geniune pleasure.

And I wonder if that's because _he never bottoms out_. I've bottomed out so many times now. I chuckle when I think about them. I don't think my mini-tragedies are actually all that tragic. Yes, of course, hard at the time. Yes, if you're going through hell keep going. But maybe it was during these past two years during a self-chosen exile that showed me: it could always be worse. And it has made pleasure _that much easier_ to touch each moment.

I didn't always say that. I used to say, "this is the worst thing of all time!" High drama. I'd fling myself on the couch and have a cry for the afternoon.

But when I turn anything on its head and say, "it could always be worse," and "what's the worst that could happen here?" I see the situation differently. That difference, though slim, hasn't just once saved my life. It _keeps_ saving my life.

Whether you think mine is a life worth living means not a whit to me. 

Because the person who has to demonstrate total buy-in is me.

And I do.
