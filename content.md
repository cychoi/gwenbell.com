####Experiments in Distributed Earning

Yesterday I got a message from Chad Whitacre, head people and code wrangler at Gittip. I guess I made it onto the team somehow. Which is exciting and weird and touching. Well, first I felt touched. Because I've joined the company of people I respect, admire and want to be more like as a programmer.

This week I started learning Vim. I got some [magic potions from Zed Shaw](https://twitter.com/gwenbell/status/351545304857849856), and several suggestions to use [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/), which helps dull the pain. 

On the Gittip front, I'm now earning enough to say I'm earning a portion of my living on Gittip. That's amazing. I'm grateful to be able to do the work, and know that even when it takes me down forks I can't describe or teach yet, which is normal, I am nonetheless supported.

I believe that's the brilliance of Gittip. The ongoing streaming income frees me up to think about and work on harder problems. If you're one of the quiet, anonymous supporters, thank you.

If you get in touch to be on the new list, holler with the things I'm listing here about myself. Your current location in the world, what you're working on, you can skip the cash reserves part, unless you want to talk about distributed earning. Which is cool by me. Let me know how my work can/does/would better support your own. -g
