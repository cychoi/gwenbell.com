####Konnichiwa bitches.

I'm Gwen Bell. I git push origin master and publish technical writing from cafes all over Brooklyn and Manhattan, New York. That photo of me is from Sayulita, Mexico. At the time I didn't know Git. Had I known it, I probably wouldn't have left the beach.

Started career as yoga studio owner in Japan. Traveled globe twice, second time out of one bag. Motherless daughter, outlived my mom. Whole and broken open. Blank slate, in love with everything. When I die my epitaph will read: **did the work**.

If you want to be added to my list of people I contact when I publish new things contact me with

1.  Your first and last name
2.  Where you live
3.  What you're working on right now
4.  How the work I'm doing can support the work you do

Questions too hard? This isn't the right list for you.
